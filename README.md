This is a poor effort but it is what it is. Next time plan better and seek help!! 

For my Tutors, I tried ot break down the problem but got stuck several times along the way and only managed to put forth this basic page with containers that show where the different sections should go. 

with a bit more time we would have been able to populate and research a few more items. For now enjoy the image of a C130 - I worked for a year as a Quality Engineer on those bad boys! super awesome and you feel so small standing in front of it. Engines buzz like a bee too - soothing humming sound. 

Thank you
